WordPress has about 10 search forms in backend. With this plugin you will have it on one place - In the Admin Bar.

== Description ==

**This plugin requires WordPress 3.3**

On the administration you can find different search forms. Some for contents like posts, pages, media or comments.
But you have also one for plugins, themes and/or users.

This plugin will centralize all search types into one search form, which is placed in the new Admin Bar.
You can change the type via a dropdown menu, take a look at the [screenshot](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-bar-backend-search/screenshots/).

Does work with network admin too.

**Sounds pretty good? Install now!**
